<p class="securityMatter">
1. Your Privacy is not for sale
Simply put, we do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Terametric uses and discloses your personal information only as follows:
</p>
  
<ul class="securityMatter" style="margin-left:50px;"><li>to analyze site usage and improve the Service; <br/></li>
<li>to deliver to you any administrative notices, money alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service; <br/></li>
<li>to fulfill your requests for certain products and services; <br/></li>
<li>for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity; <br/></li>
<li>to third-party contractors that provide services to Terametric and are bound by these same privacy restrictions; <br/></li>
<li>to enforce Terametric’s Terms of Use; and <br/></li>
<li>as otherwise set forth in this Privacy and SecurityPolicy.
</li></ul>
<p class="securityMatter">In the event that you access the Service as brought to you by one of our co-brand partners through a co-branded URL, your email address used for registration on the Service may be provided to that co-brand partner.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">2. We limit the collection and use of personal information
Certain areas and features of Terametric.com are available to you without registration or the need to provide to us any information. However, other features of the Site or the Service may require registration, which involves provision to Terametric of an email address, a password and your zip code and to participate on our forum boards, a username (collectively the "Registration Information"). In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Service, you also must provide your third-party account credentials ("Account Credentials") to allow Terametric to access your account data at those other financial institutions ("Account Information") for your use. </p>
<p class="securityMatter">
From time to time we may request other personal information to provide you with other benefits of the Service. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. Terametric may make anonymous or aggregate personal information and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:
</p>
<ul class="securityMatter" style="margin-left:50px;"><li>Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes, such as the number of users who applied for a credit card or how many users clicked on a particular Terametric Offer; <br/></li>
<li>Organizations approved by Terametric that conduct research into consumer spending; and <br/></li>
<li>Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their personal financial situation relative to the broader community.
</li></ul>
<p class="securityMatter">
Such information does not identify you individually. Access to your Registration Information, Account Credentials, Account Information and any other personal information you provide is strictly restricted and used in accordance with specific internal procedures and safeguard governing access, in order to operate, develop or improve the Service. These individuals have been selected in accordance with our security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. They may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We may also use third party vendors or service providers to help us provide the Service to you, such as sending e-mail messages on our behalf or hosting and operating a particular feature or functionality of the Service. Our contracts with these third parties outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit them from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they're providing. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">3. Changes to your Registration Information

When you visit Terametric.com, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Site. This information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our Web design and functionality.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">"Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Terametric may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you. Terametric may gather information about you through cookie technology. For example, Terametric may assign a cookie to you, to limit the amount of times you see a particular Terametric Offer or to help better determine which Terametric Offers to serve to you. Please note that most Internet browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to eliminate cookies, the full functionality of the Service may be impaired for you.
</p>
<p class="securityMatter">We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">
Web beacons are images embedded in a Web page or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity. Terametric, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons to help us analyze Site usage and improve the Service.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyze visitor activity on Terametric.com. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for Terametric. We do not share any personal information about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect such information on our behalf. Our third party service providers are required to comply fully with this Privacy and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">5. Third parties offering other products or services will not be given your personal information without your permission
There are a number of separate products and services offered by third parties advertised by us on our Site and through the Service that may be complementary to your use of Terametric.com, such as lenders, banks, credit card issuers and brokerage institutions (collectively, “Terametric Offers”). </p>
<p class="securityMatter">If you choose to use these separate products or services, disclose information to the providers, or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. Terametric is not responsible for their privacy practices. If you click on a link to a third party site, Terametric encourages you to check the privacy policy of that site. Terametric may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and whether any action has been taken on a third party Web site. We use this information to improve the quality of the Terametric Offers and customized content on the Service.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">6. Blogs and other Forums on Terametric.com</p>
<p class="securityMatter">If you use a bulletin board, blog or chat room on our Site, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"> We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. These forums may be hosted by Terametric or by one of our third party service providers on Terametric's behalf.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">7. Contests, Giveaways and Surveys
From time to time, Terametric may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. </p>
<p class="securityMatter">Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy and Security Policy, except as specifically set forth in the rules for those contests, giveaways or promotions. From time to time, Terametric may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help Terametric improve the Site. Any personal information provided to Terametric in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey and as elsewhere set forth in this Policy.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">8. Disclosure of your information to protect our rights or if required by law</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Terametric reserves the right (and you authorize Terametric) to share or disclose your personal information when Terametric determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information is necessary or appropriate:
</p>
<ul class="securityMatter" style="margin-left:50px;"><li>To enforce our rights against you or in connection with a breach by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or the Terametric.com Terms of Use; <br></li><li>To prevent prohibited or illegal activities; or <br/></li>
<li>When required by any applicable law, rule regulation, subpoena or other legal process.
</li></ul>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">9. Your data may be transferred upon change of control but only in accordance with this Policy</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Personal information may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change of control. If we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will be asked if you'd like to stop receiving promotional information following any change of control. 
</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">10. You can transport or delete your data</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Your data is yours. You can remove it anytime you want. When you request us to delete your account for the Service, your data will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. We will also promptly disconnect any connection we had established to your Account Information and delete all account credentials. However, portions of your data, consisting of aggregate data derived from your Account Information, may remain on our production servers indefinitely. Your data may also remain on a backup server or media. Terametric keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers. We also reserve the right to use any aggregated or anonymous data derived from or incorporating your personal information.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">11. Email communications from us</p>
<p class="securityMatter">We provide our registered customers with weekly summaries of their Account Information and email alerts. We also allow users to subscribe to email newsletters and from time to time may transmit emails promoting Terametric or third-party goods or services.
Terametric.com subscribers have the ability to opt-out of receiving our promotional emails and to terminate their newsletter subscriptions by following the instructions in the emails. Opting out in this manner will not end transmission of service-related emails, such as email alerts. </p><p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to To</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">12. Your data is secure</p>
<p class="securityMatter">We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Terametric.com accounts and systems from unauthorized access.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">When you register for the Service, Terametric requires a password from you for your privacy and security. Terametric transmits information such as your Registration Information for Terametric.com or Account Credentials securely.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Our servers are in a secure facility. Access requires multiple levels of authentication, including biometrics recognition procedures. Security personnel monitor the system 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Our databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. We encrypt your Service password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by us. All backup drives and tapes also are encrypted.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">We enforce physical access controls to our buildings.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">No employee may put any sensitive content on any insecure machine (i.e., nothing can be taken from the database and put on an insecure laptop).</p>
<p class="securityMatter">Terametric has been verified by Authorize.net for its use of SSL encryption technologies. In addition, Terametric tests the Site daily for any failure points that would allow hacking.</p>
<p class="securityMatter">However, it is important to understand that these precautions apply only to our Site and systems. We exercise no control over how your information is stored, maintained or displayed by third parties or on third-party sites.</p>
<p class="securityMatter"><a href="#" style="color: #787E89">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="securityMatter">13. Our service ensures secure communications with encryption</p>
<p class="securityMatter">From the time you submit your Login ID and Password, these communications between your computer and Terametric.com are encrypted. This enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery.</p>

<p class="securityMatter">14. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login ID and Password</p>
<p class="securityMatter">We maintain strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. We also recommend that you change your password periodically. Your password must be 6-8 characters in length. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Login ID and Password. You may not provide these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:security@terametric.com" mce_href="mailto:security@terametric.com">security@Terametric.com</a>, but in any event you should change your password immediately via the Service.
